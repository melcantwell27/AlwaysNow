    <h2>Inside we have a love</h2>
      <p>Love that encompasses all. Many different sides & tastes. </p>

    <h2>of Music</h2>
      <p>I like to play whatever is around. I seek out to play the trumpet and my voice the most. 
        When I started making music a few years ago, I began hearing music in more and more places. 
        Like in the construction project to build a new rehab center across the street from where I live. 
        I love the sounds of machinery & mechanical, as well as the songs of organic life, like birds, footsteps. </p>
    <h2>and Air</h2>
      <p> Air is essential for my physical breathing, as well other types of breathing. 
        A friend pointed out the importance of getting air deep into your belly recently, that has been helpful to keep energy flowing deep in the belly. 
        I like to take deep breaths, or "calm" breaths - all about what is trying to be invoked, called upon. 
        Each breath is beautiful and has its own unique signature of influence on the wellness of a living being. The air carries so much, and they quite enjoy being moved (is my sense!).
      </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">Big Air</p>

      <p>You can check out my song <a href="https://github.com/melcantwell27/AlwaysNow/blob/main/Drop_Breathe_Burn.wav" id="HightlightMe">"Air-Confounds"</a>. 
        The body can be seen as a vessel for air, and at a certain point of breath-FUllness, it can be realized that the only boundary b/w the air inside of us and the outside is a bit of fleshy material. 
        The vastness of the outside space is within. The air within is an extension, a part of, the air outside.</p>
    <h2>which also exists outside</h2>
      <p>How very big this is. 
      <p>There is a park near where I live, called Lincoln Terrace Park. I walk there nearly every day. 
        There there are big <a href="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1571117/pexels-photo-1571117.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2">squirrels</a> that hang out over there. 
        Their movement inspires me, especially how skilled they are at climbing up tree trunks, jumping between tree branches, all that. They often do this while in play with other squirrels. 
        I love that part too. They'll climb chain link fences & scurry across telephone wires too - OG slackliners. They are dancers of the tall Earth.</p>
